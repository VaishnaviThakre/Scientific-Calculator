## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Advanced mathematical functions: trigonometric, logarithmic, exponential, and more
- Support for parentheses to enforce operation precedence
- User-friendly interface with clear display of input and output

## Installation

To get started with the Scientific Calculator, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:VaishnaviThakre/Scientific-Calculator.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd Scientific-Calculator
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**

   Depending on the implementation, you might need to install specific libraries. For example, if the calculator is implemented in Python:
